# BREAKING CHANGE -- Sorry!

  The `excelsior` color scheme has moved. If you just got an error message then
  please make sure to adjust your settings appropriately:

  First, you will want to update your global settings, easiest way to do that:
    Command Palette > "UI: Select Color Scheme" > "excelsior"

  You might have also defined syntax-specific settings at one point. Open a 
  source.es or source.js file and then go to:
    Sublime Text Preferences > "Settings - Syntax Specific"
  ... and check if you need to update the `color_scheme` key in the JSON config.
